Development Methodology: Kanban board for tracking progress and discord for communication
Communication plan: We will be using discord to communicate to each other on how we and any concerns that we need to share. We will be using kanban through discord which will also share how we are individually doing on our progress.
Meeting plan: Meeting with TA on Mondays at 6:00 . We do not have a set day and time for team meetings since our schedules are all over the place, but we will make sure to meet once every 2 weeks to put our work together. Since our group is 6 we will split people up into small groups to work on features and they will be able to communicate and work together while they are making that feature.
